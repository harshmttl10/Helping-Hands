		Acid attack is one of the most violent crimes against women. It has been estimated that around a thousand of women suffer acid attack per year in India. This article brings to you the latest news about acid attack, the reason behind these attacks, the effect of acid attack on women and the laws against the attack.

		<p> 
			Incidence of acid attacks mostly occur when a women denies to be in a relationship with a man. Some men can't handle rejection of any kind and they take revenge in form of acid attack. Sometimes, family disputes too result in acid attack. The women are thought to be vulnerable enough to take revenge in such form. There has also been cases where petty fights between couples has resulted in acid attack. It is very easy for a criminal to throw acid on the face of a woman and run away. Acid is used in day to day life for cleaning of kitchen, washroom, jewellery etc. Thus it is easily available in market at a low cost. The criminal is successful in hiding his identity by covering his face during the crime. This is the reason why there has been tremendous increase in this heinous crime in recent times.

This battle is not against any nation or religion. It's against the nature which is trying to give us a lesson. We all know that we don't have any vaccine or medicine to cure it. The only way to fight it is by unity which we all need to show right now. We have seen that many countries have declared lockdown just like ours. It not only disturbing the people but even affecting the country development and economy very badly. But the main motive out here is just to save the people.

				Natural disasters in India, many of them related to the climate of India, cause massive losses of life and property. Droughts, flash floods, cyclones, avalanches, landslides brought by torrential rains, and snowstorms pose the greatest threats. A natural disaster might be caused by earthquakes, flooding, volcanic eruption, landslides, hurricanes etc. In order to be classified as a disaster it will have profound environmental effect and/or human loss and frequently incurs financial loss. Other dangers include frequent summer dust storms, which usually track from north to south; they cause extensive property damage in North India and deposit large amounts of dust from arid regions. Hail is also common in parts of India, causing severe damage to standing crops such as rice and wheat and many more crops. Many people are facing a lot of problem due to these disasters. Many people even lost there lives in such situations. Some children even lost there parents and left alone. There home are destroyed. Even fields are destroyed. So, our team have started providing the money to the ones who's houses are destroyed and the they can't build a new one due to shortage of money. We provide the food in that area which is flooded as the food can't be made there.
